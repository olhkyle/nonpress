- Built with Custom Core Library such as React `Reconciliation` with TypeScript
- Designed a CBD library based on the implemented Diffing(Reconciliation) algorithm, using `Class` (ES6+) syntax
- Implemented various DOM event interactions using **Event Delegation**
- Define Components as declarative views with state
